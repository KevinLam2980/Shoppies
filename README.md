Hello! Welcome to my interpretation of the Shoppies application!

Instructions for use: 
1) allow application to render.
2) Type in a movie name (spaces are supported), and allow the search results to populate with the movies of your desire. Some movies wont load until the full name is typed in as a limitation of the API, but live search functionality is active in the sense that a get request will be called upon every onchange of the search input. 
3) Hover over a movie and click to nominate the moive. Your movie should disappear from the search results (disabling you from nominating the same movie more than once) and appear in the nominations list (located to the right or at the bottom of the screen depending on your device). The move along with additional information and a link to the official IMDB website should appear. 
4) To remove a nominated movie, simply press 'remove movie' at the bottom right, or very bottom of the screen, depending on your screen.
5) Once you have reached 5 nominated movies, you should will have a chance to make further adjustments, or submit your nominations.
